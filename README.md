# bract.demo.wordcount

A minimal demo command-line app for the Bract framework. The problem statement this app solves is as follows:

- Count and report the number of words in a given text passed via STDIN.
- Exclude the configured stop words from the count.


## Usage

### Running the application

You can build the app locally and run it as follows:

```shell
$ lein do clean, uberjar
$ echo "A quick brown fox" | java -jar target/uberjar/bract.demo.wordcount-0.1.0-standalone.jar -vf config.edn
```

Alternatively, you may like to run it as follows in development:

```shell
$ echo "A quick brown fox" | lein do clean, run -vf config.edn
```


### REPL based development

The following may be often helpful when working at the REPL:

```clojure
(require 'dev)
(dev/init)    ; initialize the app (also reload config files)
(dev/deinit)  ; de-initialize the app
(dev/reinit)  ; reload modified namespaces and re-initialize the app
(dev/start)   ; run the app reading input from STDIN
```
